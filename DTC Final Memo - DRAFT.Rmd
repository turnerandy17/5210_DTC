#### Introduction

Our team dives into a dataset on global suicides. In this analysis, we conducted an exploratory analysis, and then developed a dashboard. We feel that by using data to investigate suicides, we can help inform actionable insights and spread awareness on the issue of suicide.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Data Set Description:

We pulled our data from Kaggle, located here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016?page=2 

This is a compiled dataset from the World Health Organization, World Bank, and United Nations members on suicide rates. It contains reported suicide numbers, Human Development Index (HDI), and the Gross Domestic (GDP) reported per country from 1985 to 2016. There are 101 countries represented in the data. The dataset also contains a field for generation (ex: Millennials, Generation X, Generation Z). The data is formatted as a CSV file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Story you want to get across: 



The story we want to get across and communicate is that suicide rates vary by country, the GDPs of each country are associated with suicide rates, and suicide rates vary between each generational group and sex. We want to tell the story that certain countries/demographic groups struggle more with suicide and that by focusing on these demographic groups or countries, we can better understand how to begin addressing the issue of suicide.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### How you set out to tell that story, and what interesting question it answers:

One of the first charts we want to make is a global heat map visual that shows the suicide rate for that country as a certain highlighted color. We'd like to incorporate filtering on this chart by calendar year in order to see how the suicide rates for that country change over time.

The next chart we want to create is a tree-map visualization of suicide rates by generational group that can be filtered by year or country. For the tree-map we want to display the generational group name, the suicide rate, and choose an aesthetically pleasing color palette.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Results and Our Story Explained:

Our analysis reveals that the overwhelming majority of suicides are from males. We see in our first visual for all suicide globally between 1985-2016, nearly 5.2M males committed suicide. This is almost 4x higher than the suicide rate for females.

Generationally, Boomers and the Silent generation comprised the highest number of suicides in our data set. 




Lastly, the majority of suicides affect those in their 'middle-age', typically individuals between the ages of 35-54 years old.

#### Recommendations and Final Thoughts

The issue of suicide is a sobering one. We hope to use
